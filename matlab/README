The starting point of the tutorial is the Matlab script exercises.m.
In this script you will find several exercises to be completed. For each of them, the instructions/suggestions are provided as comments in the script and you have to add some lines of code where requested.

We provide also a complete version of the same script (exercises_solutions.m).

The file with solutions is intended to be used as a reference and we usually do not provide them in class.
